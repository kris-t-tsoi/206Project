Limitations
	-When the video ends or is skipped back before the start the video must be re-selected
	-Overwrites files if the name the user types for a file is already in use (design decision - the output 	file names are easily visible and the user must type the exact same name to overwrite)
	-There is no logger, so all error messages are displayed in console
	- Added AudioTrack table does not auto-refresh (must be closed and then opened again

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs
	-There may be a bug where the video does not have sound when it is loaded (could be virtualbox-	
	specific). It is usually resolved by reloading the video or pressing the mute button twice.
